# NPM Packages

For quick start with SpaceShoes and applications that don't need extra asset files or custom gems, a simple NPM package based on ruby.wasm is all you need.

## Publishing

* Update version number in package.json
* Build correct version of space_shoes (packed_wasm and spacewalk) in main repo
* npm login
* npm publish --access public

JSDelivr takes a few minutes to mirror the latest release from NPM.
